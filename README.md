# 🧗‍♂️ C4 Climbing Logger

A web-based application built with React, designed to serve as a **digital climbing logbook** for **C4 Climbing Kristianstad**, a climbing gym in Sweden.

This project aims to provide an intuitive and accessible interface for climbers to **log their ascents**, **view available bouldering problems**, and stay connected with the gym’s constantly evolving route set.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The application consists of two primary components:

### 🔧 Backend
A dedicated backend service will:
- Fetch the list of climbing routes available at the gym.
- Accept user-submitted logs of new climbs.
- Handle storage and retrieval of data via a database connection.

### 💻 Frontend
A responsive, mobile-friendly user interface built with **ReactJS** and **TailwindCSS**, allowing users to:
- Browse and filter climbing problems.
- Submit new climbs to their personal log.

## 📌 To Do

### ✅ Frontend
