# 🧗‍♂️ C4 Climbing Logger

A web-based application built with React, designed to serve as a **digital climbing logbook** for **C4 Climbing Kristianstad**, a climbing gym in Sweden.

This project aims to provide an intuitive and accessible interface for climbers to **log their ascents**, **view available bouldering problems**, and stay connected with the gym’s constantly evolving route set.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The application consists of two primary components:

### 🔧 Backend
A dedicated backend service will:
- Fetch the list of climbing routes available at the gym.
- Accept user-submitted logs of new climbs.
- Handle storage and retrieval of data via a database connection.

### 💻 Frontend
A responsive, mobile-friendly user interface built with **ReactJS** and **TailwindCSS**, allowing users to:
- Browse and filter climbing problems.
- Submit new climbs to their personal log.

## 📌 To Do

### ✅ Backend - to implement
- Node.js: Runtime environment to run JavaScript backend code.
- Express: Framework for creating API endpoints and handling HTTP requests.
- MongoDB: NoSQL database for storing boulder problems and related data.
- Mongoose: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library to interact with MongoDB using schemas.
- dotenv: Loads environment variables from .env file (e.g., database URI, port).
- Nodemon: Auto-restarts backend server when files change (development only).
- CORS: Allows the React frontend to make API requests to the backend from a different origin.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **React JS** – for building the user interface.
- **Tailwind CSS** – for fast, utility-first styling.
- **Axios** – for handling HTTP requests (planned).
- **Node.js / Express (planned)** – for backend server and API.
- **Database** – TBD (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL).
